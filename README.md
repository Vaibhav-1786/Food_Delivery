A full-stack food delivery platform with three separate portals — **Customer**, **Restaurant**,
and **Admin** — built with **React (Vite)** on the frontend, **Python/Flask** on the backend, and
**MySQL** for storage. It goes well beyond a basic ordering flow: loyalty & referrals, group
ordering, meal planning, subscriptions, flash sales, surplus deals, fraud detection, disputes,
and more are all included.

# Architecture of Food Delivery 
<img width="5796" height="5520" alt="Architecture" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/078bb840-190b-42d9-9abd-611e422f8537" />

## 1. What's included

**Customer**
- OTP-verified registration/login, Google Sign-In, password reset
- Food browsing/search/filter, cart, checkout (Razorpay / COD / Wallet), delivery addresses,
  favorites, ratings & reviews
- Order history, live order tracking, scheduled orders, reordering, photo-based reorder, AI
  recipe-to-order and AI assistant chat
- Loyalty points, referral program, wallet, food streaks, meal planner, group ordering with
  voting & bill splitting, "Quick Bite" pass/subscriptions, chef specials, surplus/flash deals,
  nutrition info, disputes, and a General Knowledge mini-game with server-verified wallet rewards

**Restaurant**
- Application + admin-approval gating, profile management
- Food CRUD scoped to their own restaurant, combos, flash sales, chef specials, surplus deals
- Order management with a proper status state machine, kitchen status tracking, subscription/plan
  management

**Admin**
- Restaurant approval/rejection/deactivation, customer management, category & food management
  across all restaurants
- Orders & payments monitoring, promotions, loyalty, referrals, passes/subscriptions, sponsored
  listings, disputes, fraud detection center, GK question bank, analytics dashboards (order
  heatmap, peak-hour analytics)

**Platform-wide**
- Role-based access control enforced **on the backend API**, not just hidden in the UI — a
  customer's token cannot call restaurant/admin endpoints, and vice versa
- Passwords hashed with bcrypt, JWT session tokens, server-side validation on all sensitive
  operations (wallet debits, GK rewards, Razorpay signature verification, fraud checks)

### Tech stack

## 4. Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- A MySQL 8.0+ server (local or hosted — e.g. RDS, PlanetScale, Azure MySQL, etc.)
- (Optional, for live payments) A Razorpay account and API keys
- (Optional, for the AI assistant / recipe-to-order features) A free [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) API key
- (Optional, for "Continue with Google" login) A Google OAuth Client ID

---

## 5. Backend setup

```bash
cd food-delivery-app/backend
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate          # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

cp .env.example .env
# then edit .env and fill in at least:
#   DB_HOST, DB_PORT, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD, DB_NAME
#   SECRET_KEY, JWT_SECRET_KEY (any long random strings)
# optional:
#   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID                          (Google Sign-In)
#   RAZORPAY_KEY_ID / RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET      (live payments)
#   AI_API_KEY / AI_MODEL / AI_BASE_URL        (AI assistant & recipe-to-order)
#   MAIL_HOST / MAIL_PORT / MAIL_USERNAME /
#   MAIL_PASSWORD / MAIL_FROM_EMAIL / MAIL_FROM_NAME,
#   FRONTEND_URL, EMAIL_ENABLED=1              (real registration + forgot-password email OTP —
#                                                see section 7 "Real Email OTP Setup")
```

If no `DB_HOST`/`DB_USER` are set, the app falls back to a local SQLite file
(`backend/dev_fallback.db`) so it can boot without MySQL — useful for a quick look, but the schema
and migrations below target MySQL and are the supported path.

### Create the database schema

```bash
mysql -h <host> -u <user> -p < ../database/schema.sql
```

Then apply the migrations **in numeric order** to layer on the full feature set:

```bash
for f in ../database/migrations/*.sql; do
  mysql -h <host> -u <user> -p food_delivery < "$f"
done
```

Finally, seed reference data (states/cities, categories, GK question bank):

```bash
mysql -h <host> -u <user> -p food_delivery < ../database/seed.sql
```

### Seed admin + sample restaurants + sample food

This step also seeds states/categories/questions if you skipped the SQL files above (it's
idempotent — safe to run against a database that already has some of this data):

```bash
cd food-delivery-app          # repo root, not backend/
python -m backend.utils.seed_runner
```

This prints out the login credentials it creates, e.g.:

```
Created admin login -> email: admin@fooddelivery.com  password: Admin@123
Created restaurant -> email: spicevilla@example.com  password: Restaurant@123  (status: approved)
...
```

**Change these passwords** (or create your own admin/restaurant accounts) before going live.

### Run the backend

```bash
cd backend
python -m backend.app
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:5000/api`. Check `http://localhost:5000/api/health`.

---

## 6. Frontend setup

```bash
cd food-delivery-app/frontend
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env if needed (VITE_API_BASE, VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID)
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173`.

For production build:

```bash
npm run build      # outputs to frontend/dist — serve with any static host / nginx
```

---

## 7. Logging in

- **Customer**: `http://localhost:5173/register` (OTP is simulated by default — see below), or
  "Continue with Google" if `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` / `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` are configured
- **Restaurant**: `http://localhost:5173/restaurant/login` (use a seeded account, or apply via
  `/restaurant/register` and approve it from the admin panel)
- **Admin**: `http://localhost:5173/admin/login` — this URL is intentionally not linked from the
  customer-facing navbar. Use the credentials printed by `seed_runner.py`.

### Seeded login credentials

These accounts are created automatically the first time you run
`python -m backend.utils.seed_runner` (see section 4). All restaurant accounts are seeded with
`status: approved`, so they can log in immediately without waiting on admin approval.

| Role       | Restaurant / Name    | Email                       | Password         |
|------------|-----------------------|------------------------------|-------------------|
| Admin      | Platform Admin        | `admin@fooddelivery.com`     | `Admin@123`       |
| Restaurant | Spice Villa           | `spicevilla@example.com`     | `Restaurant@123`  |
| Restaurant | Urban Bites           | `urbanbites@example.com`     | `Restaurant@123`  |
| Restaurant | The Curry House       | `curryhouse@example.com`     | `Restaurant@123`  |
| Restaurant | Green Leaf Kitchen    | `greenleaf@example.com`      | `Restaurant@123`  |

> ⚠️ These are **development-only** credentials meant for local testing. Change them (or delete
> these accounts and create your own) before deploying anywhere publicly reachable.

## 8. Integrations that need your own credentials

### OTP (mobile verification)
No SMS gateway is configured. In `OTP_DEBUG_MODE=1` (the default), the generated OTP code is
returned directly in the API response (`dev_otp` field) and shown in the UI so you can test the
full registration flow without a real SMS provider. **Before going live**, wire a real provider
(Twilio, MSG91, etc.) into `backend/services/otp_service.py` and set `OTP_DEBUG_MODE=0`.

### Real Email OTP Setup (registration + forgot password)
Registration email verification and Forgot Password both use a **real 6-digit email OTP**, sent
from the backend over SMTP (`backend/services/email_otp_service.py` + `email_service.py`) — nothing
is ever sent from React, and the OTP is never returned by the API or logged once real email is
enabled. By default `EMAIL_ENABLED=0`, so the backend logs what it *would* have sent instead of
making a real SMTP connection, letting you exercise the whole flow without any mail credentials.

**Setting up Gmail SMTP (recommended for testing/small deployments):**

1. Create or use a Gmail account for the application.
2. Turn on **2-Step Verification** on that Google account:
   [myaccount.google.com/security](https://myaccount.google.com/security).
3. Once 2-Step Verification is on, go to
   [myaccount.google.com/apppasswords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords) and create an
   **App Password** (choose "Mail" / "Other", give it a name like "QuickBite backend"). Google
   gives you a 16-character code — copy it.
4. Put the App Password into `MAIL_PASSWORD` in `backend/.env`, and fill in the rest:
   ```
   MAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
   MAIL_PORT=587
   MAIL_USERNAME=your-email@gmail.com
   MAIL_PASSWORD=the-16-character-app-password   # NOT your normal Gmail password
   MAIL_FROM_EMAIL=your-email@gmail.com
   MAIL_FROM_NAME=QuickBite

   OTP_EXPIRY_MINUTES=5
   OTP_MAX_ATTEMPTS=5
   OTP_RESEND_COOLDOWN=30
   OTP_DEBUG_MODE=0        # recommended for production; see note below

   EMAIL_ENABLED=1
   FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
   ```
5. Never commit `backend/.env`, never put the App Password (or any `MAIL_*` value) in
   `frontend/.env` or any Vite (`VITE_*`) variable, and never push it to GitHub. Only the Flask
   backend ever reads `MAIL_PASSWORD`.
6. Start the backend (`python app.py`) and frontend (`npm run dev`).
7. Test registration: `/register` → fill in the form → **Send OTP** next to Email Address → check
   your inbox/spam folder → enter the code → **Verify OTP** (turns into "✓ Email Verified") →
   complete mobile OTP the same way → **Create Account**.
8. Test Forgot Password: `/login` → **Forgot password?** → enter a real, registered email →
   **Send OTP** → check inbox/spam → enter the 6-digit code → **Verify OTP** → set a new password →
   confirm you're redirected to `/login` → log in with the new password.

Any other SMTP provider (SendGrid, Mailgun, Amazon SES, your company mail server, etc.) works the
same way — just point `MAIL_HOST` / `MAIL_PORT` at it and use its own username/password.

**`OTP_DEBUG_MODE`** only affects the *mobile*-SMS OTP endpoints (`/api/auth/otp/send` /
`/otp/verify`), which still have no real SMS gateway wired in — it controls whether `dev_otp` is
returned so you can test mobile verification locally. It has no effect on the email-OTP endpoints:
those never return the code in the response body regardless of this setting, once `EMAIL_ENABLED=1`
they always attempt a real send. Set `OTP_DEBUG_MODE=0` for production once you've wired a real SMS
provider (or if you don't need mobile verification testing locally).

Also worth testing manually: a wrong OTP (attempt counter increments, error shown), waiting past
`OTP_EXPIRY_MINUTES` before submitting (rejected as expired), 5 wrong attempts in a row (locked out,
must request a new OTP), clicking Resend before the `OTP_RESEND_COOLDOWN` timer runs out (blocked
client-side and enforced again on the backend), an unregistered email on Forgot Password (same
generic "if an account exists…" message either way), and a Google-only customer account on Forgot
Password (no email is sent — they keep using "Continue with Google").

Email OTPs are never stored raw — only a SHA-256 hash is kept in `otp_verifications.otp_hash` — are
single-use, purpose-scoped (`REGISTRATION` vs `FORGOT_PASSWORD`), and only the newest OTP for a
given email+purpose is ever valid (requesting a new one invalidates any still-open previous code).
On successful Forgot-Password OTP verification, the backend issues a short-lived, single-use
password-reset authorization token (same hashed-token mechanism as `password_reset_tokens`,
`OTP_RESET_TOKEN_EXPIRY_MINUTES`, default 10) — the frontend never asserts "OTP verified" on its
own; `/reset-password` re-validates that token server-side before changing anything.

### Google Sign-In
Set the **same** `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` in both `backend/.env` and `frontend/.env`
(`VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`). The Client Secret is never needed by this app — only the public Client
ID, used server-side to verify the token's audience. Leave it blank to keep the "Continue with
Google" button hidden. Google Sign-In is unaffected by the email-OTP system above: Google already
verifies the customer's email address, so Google-registered customers are created with
`email_verified=True` and never see an OTP step.

### Razorpay
The backend creates orders and verifies payment signatures server-side
(`backend/routes/payment_routes.py`), and the secret key is never sent to the frontend. Until you
set `RAZORPAY_KEY_ID` / `RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET` in your `.env`, choosing "Razorpay" at checkout
returns a clear "not configured" error rather than faking a successful payment. Get test keys from
your [Razorpay Dashboard](https://dashboard.razorpay.com/).

### AI Assistant / Recipe-to-Order
Uses an OpenAI-compatible `/chat/completions` endpoint via [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) by
default (free tier, no credit card required). Set `AI_API_KEY` in `backend/.env`; `AI_MODEL` and
`AI_BASE_URL` have working defaults. The key is only ever read server-side.

---

## 9. Security notes

- Passwords are hashed with bcrypt; nowhere in the API (including admin customer views) is a
  password or password hash ever returned.
- JWT tokens carry `role`, and every sensitive backend route is decorated with
  `@token_required([...])` restricting it to specific roles — enforced server-side, not just
  hidden in the UI.
- Wallet balance checks and debits happen entirely server-side (`backend/services/wallet_service.py`);
  the client can never manipulate its own balance.
- GK game rewards are generated server-side after the game session completes, guarded by a unique
  constraint on `game_rewards.session_id` so a session can only ever pay out once.
- Restaurant food/order management endpoints verify the resource belongs to the authenticated
  restaurant before allowing edits — cross-restaurant tampering returns 404.
- A dedicated fraud-detection service and admin fraud center flag suspicious activity for review.

To report a vulnerability, or for the production deployment checklist, see **[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)**.

## 10. Extending further

This is a large, working v1 covering all core and advanced flows end-to-end. Natural next steps:
push/email notifications wired to a real provider, image uploads for food/restaurant photos
(currently URL-based), a production WSGI server (gunicorn) + reverse proxy in front of Flask, and
automated tests around the pricing/wallet/fraud services.

## 11. Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome. For larger changes please open an issue first, keep database
migrations additive and numbered in order, and never commit secrets (`.env`, API keys, App
Passwords).
